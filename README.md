# align
Convert an USFM alignment file to CSV

There is a script named "runall.sh" that combines the individual chapter files into a book file.
It uses a utility from the csv-utils go package.


TODO:
- add a new column to uniquely identify the book's provance. For example, uw-en-ult (unfoldingWord's English literal translation).
- consider importing into an sqlite3 file
